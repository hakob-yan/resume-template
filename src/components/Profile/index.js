          A React Web Developer with 3+ year of experience, having skills to
          collaborate with senior and junior developers. I am in the habit of
          understanding bottlenecks by working with team members closely and
          picking up workload when necessary on my own. Having impressive
          mathematical background and ready to appreciate team members who have
          proved both soft and professional skills . Instead of wasting time I
          am eager to gain new skills by reading new books related to
          programming. I am ready to consume my passion to talented engineering
          team in order to develop new features for application.
